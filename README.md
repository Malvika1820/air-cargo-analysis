# Air Cargo Analysis | SQL

Airline booking & operations analysis built in PostgreSQL, analyzing 258K+ ticket
sales across 1,400 flights and 20 airports to identify busiest routes, revenue
trends, and the operational drivers behind customer complaints.

## Tech Stack
- **PostgreSQL** (hosted on Supabase)
- **SQL** — CTEs, window functions, aggregate queries, multi-table joins
- **Python** (data generation only — see `scripts/`)

## Schema
9 tables modeling a real-world airline reservation system: `airports_data`,
`aircrafts_data`, `seats`, `flights`, `bookings`, `tickets`, `ticket_flights`,
`boarding_passes`, `complaints`. Full ERD in [`docs/ERD.md`](docs/ERD.md).

## Key Findings

### 1. Busiest Routes
Mumbai↔Delhi is the highest-volume route (7,485 passengers, $5.4M revenue),
followed by LA↔JFK and Dubai↔Delhi. The top 5 routes account for a
disproportionate share of total network revenue — a clear signal for where to
prioritize aircraft capacity and scheduling.

### 2. Revenue Growth: +26.6%
| Period | Bookings | Revenue |
|---|---|---|
| H1 (Jan–Jun) | 114,378 | $83.8M |
| H2 (Jul–Dec) | 144,198 | $106.1M |

Revenue grew 26.6% from H1 to H2, driven by higher seat-load factors and a
shift toward self-service booking channels.

### 3. Customer Complaints: -14.7%
| Period | Complaints | Resolution Rate |
|---|---|---|
| H1 (Jan–Jun) | 12,267 | 65.7% |
| H2 (Jul–Dec) | 10,463 | 84.4% |

Complaint volume dropped 14.7% and resolution rate improved from 65.7% to
84.4% — both operational reliability and support responsiveness improved.

**What's driving complaints:**
| Type | Share |
|---|---|
| Flight Delay | 44.3% |
| Cancellation | 15.2% |
| Baggage | 15.0% |
| Customer Service | 8.6% |
| Booking Error | 7.4% |
| Overbooking | 5.7% |
| Refund Issue | 3.8% |

Nearly 60% of complaints trace back to operational reliability (delays +
cancellations), not the booking experience itself — flights that ran on time
had a 6.1% complaint rate vs. 20.4% for delayed flights and 29.3% for
cancelled ones.

### 4. Booking Channel Performance
| Channel | Bookings | Revenue | Avg. Booking Value |
|---|---|---|---|
| Website | 105,368 | $77.5M | $735.17 |
| Mobile App | 69,911 | $51.1M | $730.58 |
| Travel Agent | 59,488 | $43.9M | $737.71 |
| Call Center | 23,809 | $17.5M | $733.54 |

Self-service channels (Website + Mobile App) account for **65% of all
bookings**, ahead of Travel Agent and Call Center combined — validating
continued investment in the digital booking experience.

### 5. Seat Occupancy
Top routes (JNB–SIN, DXB–DEL, SIN–HKG) are running at ~99.7–99.8% load
factor — effectively sold out, and strong candidates for added frequency or
larger aircraft.

### 6. Fare Class Mix
| Class | Tickets | Revenue | Avg Fare |
|---|---|---|---|
| Economy | 199,783 | $116.2M | $581.56 |
| Business | 20,435 | $38.1M | $1,862.03 |
| Comfort | 38,358 | $35.7M | $929.44 |

Business class is only 8% of tickets sold but contributes ~19% of total
revenue — a high-margin segment worth protecting on capacity-constrained
routes.

## How to Reproduce
1. Create a PostgreSQL database (e.g. via [Supabase](https://supabase.com), free tier)
2. Run `sql/01_schema.sql` in the SQL editor
3. Import each CSV in `data/` into its matching table, in this order (foreign key dependencies): `airports_data → aircrafts_data → seats → flights → bookings → tickets → ticket_flights → boarding_passes → complaints`
4. Run the queries in `sql/02_analysis_queries.sql`

## Notes on the Dataset
This project uses a synthetically generated dataset modeled on real-world
airline reservation system schemas (the classic bookings → tickets →
ticket_flights structure used in several public airline demo databases).
Data was engineered to reflect realistic seasonal patterns: seat-load factors
and booking-channel mix shift over the year, and complaint rates correlate
with flight delay/cancellation status — mirroring how a real airline dataset
behaves after an operational improvement initiative.
